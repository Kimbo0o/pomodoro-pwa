# pomodoro-pwa

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer PWA. I mainly develop this App to get some experience with React.js and PWA and to try out a Glassmorphism UI. I also just wanted a Pomodoro app that worked to my liking.

## Development

This App is developed unsing React.js. The Settings will be stored locally. I might add Online Storage later.
